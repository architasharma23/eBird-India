# Spatial sampling (no filters)  

In this script, we will examine data at the species level for a chosen list of species, across its entire geographic range in the Indian subcontinent. Our aim here is to first understand the proportion of checklists that report the species of interests for every 25 x 25 km grid size (finer scale will be chosen for comparison in a future script).  

No other filters are applied in this particular script.

```{r}
# load libraries
library(data.table)
library(readxl)
library(magrittr)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

# round any function
round_25 <- function(x, accuracy = 25000) {
  round(x / accuracy) * accuracy
}

# set file paths for auk functions
# To use these two datasets, please download the latest versions from https://ebird.org/data/download and set the file path accordingly. Since these two datasets are extremely large, we have not uploaded the same to GitHub.
# In this study, the version of data loaded corresponds to July 2022.

f_in_ebd <- file.path("data/ebd_IN_relJul-2022.txt")
f_in_sampling <- file.path("data/ebd_sampling_relJul-2022.txt")
```


## Subset observations by geographical confines of the study area  

In this case, the geographical confines correspond to the political boundary of India.   
```{r}
# first, we load the India states boundary from GADM
india_states <- st_read("data/spatial/shapefiles/india_states_boundary.shp")
box_in <- st_bbox(india_states)

# read in ebd data and subset by state for our analysis
# To access the latest dataset, please visit: https://ebird.org/data/download and set the file path accordingly.

ebd <- fread("data/ebd_IN_relJul-2022.txt")

# subsettting by lat-long
ebd_in <- ebd[between(LONGITUDE, box_in["xmin"], box_in["xmax"]) &
  between(LATITUDE, box_in["ymin"], box_in["ymax"]), ] # resulted in removal of 21 observations in total

# make new column names
newNames <- str_replace_all(colnames(ebd_in), " ", "_") %>%
  str_to_lower()
setnames(ebd_in, newNames)
# keep useful columns
columnsOfInterest <- c(
  "common_name", "scientific_name", "observation_count", "locality", "state", "locality_id", "locality_type", "latitude",
  "longitude", "observation_date", "time_observations_started", "protocol_type","duration_minutes","effort_distance_km", "number_observers", "group_identifier", "reviewed", "sampling_event_identifier"
)
ebd_in <- ebd_in[, ..columnsOfInterest]

# remove the large ebd file if it's not required
rm(ebd)
gc() # run this function to clear up some memory space
```

## Data cleaning prior to visualization
```{r}
# Convert all presences marked 'X' as '1'
ebd_in <- ebd_in %>%
  mutate(observation_count = ifelse(observation_count == "X",
    "1", observation_count
  ))

# Convert observation count to numeric
ebd_in$observation_count <- as.numeric(ebd_in$observation_count)
```

## Load spatial grids for checklist locations

Add a spatial filter.  
```{r strict_filter_supp02}
# strict spatial filter and assign grid
locs <- ebd_in[, .(longitude, latitude)]

# transform to UTM 
coords <- setDF(locs) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude")) %>%
  `st_crs<-`(4326) %>%
  bind_cols(as.data.table(st_coordinates(.))) %>%
  st_transform("+proj=laea +lon_0=80.859375 +lat_0=20.6486698 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs") %>%
  mutate(id = 1:nrow(.))

# make some empty space
gc()

# convert to UTM for filter
india_states <- st_transform(india_states, "+proj=laea +lon_0=80.859375 +lat_0=20.6486698 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")

coords <- coords %>%
  filter(id %in% unlist(st_contains(india_states, coords))) %>%
  rename(longitude = X, latitude = Y) %>%
  bind_cols(as.data.table(st_coordinates(.))) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  as.data.table()

# remove unneeded objects
rm(locs)
gc()

coords <- coords[, .N, by = .(longitude, latitude, X, Y)]

ebd_in <- merge(ebd_in, coords, all = FALSE, by = c("longitude", "latitude"))
ebd_in <- ebd_in[(longitude %in% coords$longitude) &
  (latitude %in% coords$latitude), ]
```

## Get proportional observation counts across every 25 km x 25 km grid

Analysis of proportional counts estimated at 25km
```{r}
## Analysis of proportional counts at 25 km for each state

# round to 25km cell in UTM coords
ebd_in[, `:=`(X = round_25(X), Y = round_25(Y))]

# count checklists in cell
ebd_summary <- ebd_in[, nchk := length(unique(sampling_event_identifier)),
  by = .(X, Y)]

# count checklists reporting each species in cell and get proportion
ebd_summary <- ebd_summary[, .(nrep = length(unique(
  sampling_event_identifier
))),
by = .(X, Y, nchk, scientific_name)
]
ebd_summary[, p_rep := nrep / nchk]

# complete the dataframe for no reports
# keep no reports as NA --- allows filtering based on proportion reporting
ebd_summary <- setDF(ebd_summary) %>%
  complete(
    nesting(X, Y), scientific_name # ,
    # fill = list(p_rep = 0)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(p_rep))
```

## Filter data only for a specific list of species

We filtered data for a subset of 891 species. 
```{r}
# remove species that are poorly reported (only filter being applied at this stage)
# for example, accounts such as 'Turdidae sp.', are removed and only the latest
# list of scientific names are taken into consideration

species_list <- read.csv("data/2022-SoIB-species-list.csv")
speciesOfInterest <- species_list %>%
  filter(Selected...SOIB =="X")
speciesOfInterest <- data.frame(speciesOfInterest$Scientific.Name)
names(speciesOfInterest) <- "scientific_name"

# filter for species list above - we are choosing only the 891 species
ebd_summary <- ebd_summary[ebd_summary$scientific_name %in% speciesOfInterest$scientific_name, ]
```

## Checklist distribution 

```{r }
# total number of checklists across unique grids
tot_n_chklist <- ebd_summary %>%
  distinct(X, Y, nchk)

# India has a total of 4792 unique 25 x 25 km grids

# species-specific number of grids
spp_grids <- ebd_summary %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  distinct(X, Y) %>%
  count(scientific_name,
    name = "n_grids"
  )

# Write the above two results
write.csv(spp_grids, "results/01_ngrids-per-spp.csv", row.names=F)

# left-join the datasets
ebd_summary <- left_join(ebd_summary, spp_grids, by = "scientific_name")
```

## What species are reported sufficiently in checklists?

Similar to Ramesh et al. (2022), we visualized and listed species that occurred in atleast 5% of all checklists across half of the unique study area grids they were reported from. 

```{r}
p_cutoff <- 0.05 # Proportion of checklists a species has been reported in

grid_proportions <- ebd_summary %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  tally(p_rep >= p_cutoff) %>% # n here is the number of grids in which a species has been reported in over 5% of checklists
  mutate(prop_grids_cut = n / (spp_grids$n_grids)) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_grids_cut))

grid_prop_cut <- filter(
  grid_proportions,
  prop_grids_cut >= 0.5 # How many species have been reported in atleast 5% of checklists across atleast 50% of the grids they have been reported from? 
)

# Only 254 species!

# Write the results
write.csv(grid_prop_cut, "results/01_prop-grids-per-spp.csv", row.names = F)

# Identifying the number of species that occur in potentially <5% of all lists
total_number_lists <- sum(tot_n_chklist$nchk)

spp_sum_chk <- ebd_summary %>%
  distinct(X, Y, scientific_name, nrep) %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  mutate(sum_chk = sum(nrep)) %>%
  distinct(scientific_name, sum_chk)

# 88 species of the list of 877 occur in >5% of all checklists
prop_all_lists <- spp_sum_chk %>%
  mutate(prop_lists = sum_chk / total_number_lists) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_lists))
```

## Figure: Proportion of checklists reporting species in each grid cell

Note: Here we plot all species that occur in atleast 5% of all checklists across half of the 25 x 25 km cells from where they have been reported
